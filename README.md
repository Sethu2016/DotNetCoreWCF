# DotNetCoreWCF

Code in this repository was created for my blog post [Using WCF with DotNetCore](https://www.seeleycoder.com/blog/using-wcf-with-dotnetcore/)

The basic premise is that WCF is not yet a first class citizen in DotNetCore do to some reliance on Windows specific functionality (hence the name Windows Communication Foundation).

This project will show some ways that you can still use WCF in DotNetCore alongside other full framework projects in the same solution.  The blog post goes into detail why this is not a good idea, however.
